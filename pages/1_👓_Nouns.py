st.write(""" This website is a new model of essential DAO (decentralized autonomous organizations), where you can even see that a communal treasury taken to the next level with governance and ownership. In this platform anyone who owns one of these tokens and holds a noun, nft, essentially gets a vote in what happens with this treasury,So if you just go to the website, which is [nouns. wtf], you can see the current auction. With the current concept of one little noun every 15 minutes, the auctions can run every day every 15 minutes, and in real time, there are 28156 Ethereum, or 50.87 million dollars, in this wallet. The only way to access this wallet because of the only through this website, so you can't go to that wallet any other way, and as you can see, there's been 294 different proposals. To put up a proposal, you need to own a certain amount of these, and you need people that are going to vote on them. You can see the votes for it, or the voice against it. You can see people that abstained; it even tells you how many votes are needed, right? So I'm showing you the broad strokes of this so you can get an understanding of what little nouns really are, which is a crowd-funded treasury that can be accessed with a crowd vote. this decentralized autonomous organization It's incredibly cool. There are really interesting opportunities to get funded for, like, literally, ideas you might have that would help this group of little nouns grow. The whole goal of the Treasury department of the group is to figure out how to grow the brand. how to grow awareness around little nouns and the things that are important to those that are in little nouns, and it was started by a founder.
