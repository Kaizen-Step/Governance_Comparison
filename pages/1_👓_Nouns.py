st.write(""" The Nouns website is a new model of essential DAO (decentralized autonomous organizations), where you can even see that a communal treasury has been taken to the next level with governance and ownership. On this platform, anybody who possesses a Noun, nft, and owns one of these tokens effectively has a say in what happens with the treasury. So, to view the current auction, simply visit the [nouns website ](https://nouns.wtf/). With the current concept of one little noun every 15 minutes, the auctions can run every day every 15 minutes, and in real time, there are 28156 Ethereum, or 50.87 million dollars, in this wallet. There is no other way to get to this wallet; users can only access it through this website.    
There have been 294 different proposals to help with decision-making using this deposit. To put up a proposal, you need to own a certain amount of these, and you need people that are going to vote on them. You can see the votes for it, or the voice against it. You can see people that abstained; it even tells you how many votes are needed. Nouns is a crowd-funded treasury that can be accessed with a crowd vote.. this independent decentralized organization is truly amazing. There are some extremely intriguing chances to earn funding for, literally, any ideas you might have to expand this group of little nouns. The whole goal of the Treasury department of the group is to figure out how to grow the brand. how to grow awareness around Nouns and the things that are important to those that are in Nouns. The following charts showed that the majority of noun proposals passed and only 17% were rejected by the voters.

st.write("""  When a 'Nouns' holder votes, 1 Noun NFT is the equivalent of one vote. Votes can be delegated to other wallets including non-Nouners. we can see that as the population of Noun holders increases, so does voter participation. Most proposals received votes "For" the proposal, but often the votes depend on the monetary amount from the treasury.   
Here is where the Nouns DAO starts. Despite the fact that holding an NFT restricts liquidity and DAOs demand more coordination than centralized entities, the value of the talented community and the initiatives that have been sponsored yield value to nouns.
Nouns has shown the ability to tick off a number of previously challenging DAO-related boxes, including perpetual funding, social coordination, governance and voting, memetics, and a general crypto-native aim, despite the fact that DAOs are still in their infancy.
