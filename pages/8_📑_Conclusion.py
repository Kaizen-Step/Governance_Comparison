Nouns:
Nouns is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to purchase and own unique, one-of-a-kind nouns. While nouns themselves do not have a specific governance structure, the platform they exist on, Ethereum, has a decentralized governance model. Ethereum operates on a rough consensus basis, with decisions primarily made by developers, miners, and token holders. Major protocol changes and upgrades are proposed through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and are subject to community discussion and consensus before implementation. Governance decisions on Ethereum are made through off-chain discussions, social media platforms, and forums where stakeholders voice their opinions and collaborate.

Compound:
Compound is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Compound has a decentralized governance model where COMP token holders have the power to propose and vote on changes to the protocol. The governance process is conducted on-chain through the use of Compound Governance Tokens (COMP). COMP token holders can submit proposals for protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, and new feature implementations. Once a proposal is submitted, token holders can vote on the proposal, with the voting power being proportional to the number of COMP tokens held. If a proposal receives a sufficient majority of votes, it can be implemented by the Compound protocol.

Uniswap:
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables users to swap ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets. Uniswap's governance structure has evolved over time. Initially, Uniswap had a relatively informal governance model where decisions were made primarily by the development team. However, in September 2020, Uniswap introduced the UNI governance token, giving holders the ability to participate in the platform's governance. UNI token holders can submit and vote on governance proposals related to protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, and other changes. The voting power of UNI token holders is determined by the number of tokens they hold, with a delegation feature allowing token holders to delegate their voting rights to other addresses.

Overall, the governance structures of Nouns, Compound, and Uniswap reflect the broader trend of decentralization in blockchain platforms, aiming to distribute decision-making power among stakeholders and ensure community participation in shaping the platforms' future.
