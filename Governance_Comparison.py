### Blockchain Governance,How Does It Work in Practice? ###  
Governance is a term that relates to decision making processes within an organization — who is responsible for what, how are major decisions being taken or implemented, is authority vested in a select few or distributed among all participants, etc. All those questions have different implications on an organization’s operational system, whether on a macro level (e.g. a decision on a new feature or goal) or on a micro level (e.g. how much is spent on marketing or who is responsible for a certain task). A successful governance model is usually what makes an organization click. Logically, there is no one-size-fits-all here — every model is situational and its viability largely depends on the specific circumstances.  While a participative democracy could work for some, having powers vested in a central authority may be preferable for others.    
Though as diverse as they may be, exemplary governance models are often centered around a set of qualities: transparency, integrity, effective performance and collaboration. In the context of blockchain, the discussion on governance currently revolves around two sets of models: centralized vs. decentralized and on-chain vs. off-chain. The first duel is the classic blockchain paradox which calls into question contemporary authority structures. The second refers to human involvement and the extent to which decision making processes are automated. Regardless of the governance structure, matters at stake typically involve network access, funding allocation, block size, reward systems, voting and decision making (e.g. reversing transactions via a fork).[[1]](https://watsonlaw.nl/en/blockchain-governance-what-is-it-what-types-are-there-and-how-does-it-work-in-practice/)    
      
### Nouns Governance Fork of Compound ###
Nouns DAO utilizes a fork of Compound Governance and is the main governing body of the Nouns ecosystem. The Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions. Each Noun is an irrevocable member of Nouns DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your Noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your Noun.  
The proposal veto right was initially envisioned as a temporary solution to the problem of ‘51% attacks’ on the Nouns DAO treasury. While Nounders initially believed that a healthy distribution of Nouns would be sufficient protection for the DAO, a more complete understanding of the incentives and risks has led to general consensus within the Nounders, the Nouns Foundation, and the wider community that a more robust game-theoretic solution should be implemented before the right is removed.
The Nouns community has undertaken a preliminary exploration of proposal veto alternatives (‘rage quit’ etc.), but it is now clear that this is a difficult problem that will require significantly more research, development and testing before a satisfactory solution can be implemented.
Consequently, the Nouns Foundation anticipates being the steward of the veto power until Nouns DAO is ready to implement an alternative, and therefore wishes to clarify the conditions under which it would exercise this power.
The Nouns Foundation considers the veto an emergency power that should not be exercised in the normal course of business. The Nouns Foundation will veto proposals that introduce non-trivial legal or existential risks to the Nouns DAO or the Nouns Foundation, including (but not necessarily limited to) proposals that:
unequally withdraw the treasury for personal gain
bribe voters to facilitate withdraws of the treasury for personal gain
attempt to alter Noun auction cadence for the purpose of maintaining or acquiring a voting majority
make upgrades to critical smart contracts without undergoing an audit
There are unfortunately no algorithmic solutions for making these determinations in advance (if there were, the veto would not be required), and proposals must be considered on a case by case basis.[[2]](https://nouns.wtf/)     

### Compound Governance a Fully Decentralized Model  ###
At Compound, the goal is to create financial infrastructure that applications and developers can rely on, forever. To get there, they intend to fully decentralize the Compound protocol — removing the largest single point of failure (our team), and creating an indestructible, open protocol that can evolve in entirely new ways.
Today, they’re proud to introduce a governance system that will replace the Compound protocol’s administrator with community governance — allowing you to suggest, debate, and implement changes to Compound — without relying on, or requiring, our team whatsoever.    
Participation starts with the Compound governance token, COMP.
In addition to being a standard ERC-20 asset, COMP allows the owner to delegate voting rights to the address of their choice; the owner’s wallet, another user, an application, or a DeFi expert. Anybody can participate in Compound governance by receiving delegation, without needing to own COMP. The token also includes code to query an address’ historical voting weight, which is useful for building complex voting systems.
they hope that COMP can set the standard for how governance tokens operate, and our team will write an Ethereum Improvement Plan (similar to the ERC-20 standard) to accelerate decentralization for the entire ecosystem.
COMP empowers community governance — it isn’t a fundraising device or investment opportunity. Until the decentralization process is complete, COMP will not be available to the public.[[3]](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-5531f524cf68)  


### Uniswap Recent UNI token Model ###
Several governance venues available to Uniswap governance, each serving its own particular purpose. Gov.uniswap.org 278 is a Discourse forum for governance-related discussion.     
**Phase 1: Temperature Check—Snapshot**    
The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.Ask a general, non-biased question to the community on gov.The Temperature Check process determines whether there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo. At the end of the two days, a majority vote with a 25k UNI yes-vote threshold wins. If the Temperature check does not suggest a change from the status quo, the topic will be closed on the governance site. If the Temperature Check does suggest a change, proceed to    
**Phase 2: Consensus Check — Discourse/Snapshot**     
The purpose of the Consensus Check is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal. The Consensus Check process incorporates feedback from the Temperature Check and establishes formal discussion around a potential proposal. Consensus Check is accompanied by another off-chain vote. At the end of five days, a majority vote with a 50k UNI yes-vote threshold wins.      
**Phase 3: Governance Proposal — Governance Portal**  
A Governance Proposal is the final step in the governance process. The proposal should incorporate feedback from the Consensus Check and is accompanied by executable on-chain code. In order to submit an on-chain Governance proposal, a delegate must have a minimum balance of 2m UNI. The voting period lasts 7 days and a majority vote with a 40m UNI yes-vote threshold wins.[[4]](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732)

## Methodology ##  

In this dashboard, we compare the governance structures of three protocols, namely nouns, uniswap, and compound, using the Coherent  ETHEREUM_DATASET_RAW_DECODED_AND_ENRICHED Data Sets tables.For the Nouns governance investigation, we used the 'ENRICHED.DECODED.DECODED_LOGS' table of the Coherent Enriched data set with the contract address '0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d' and the 'HASHABLE_SIGNATURE' of this table to filter each different functionality of this contract.    
First, we looked up the proposal using the "ProposalCreated" function, then we looked at "ProposalExecuted" and "ProposalCanceled" to see what happened to these proposals, and finally, using the "VoteCast" function, we totaled up all the votes that each proposal received.For Uniswap governance, the governance contract address changed over time, so we included addresses from the beginning to the present (such as "0xc4e172459f1e7939d522503b81afaac1014ce6f6" and "0xeCa491E162d157760F167c4DD92b45AE6E5Cf0f1") and investigated all of them in the same table.    
The Coherent tables also contained the description of the proposal and reasons for each vote we present them in a separate tables. Finally, using these data sets, we compare the governance metrics across the three platforms, including the number of proposals, votes, addresses, and the outcomes of each proposal over time. Timestamps were taken from "ENRICHED.DECODED.DECODED_BLOCKS" tables and combined with the results of the block hash queries in all of the queries.
